// InfluxDB is structured with Databases full of Series' which contain Measurements
// This is comparable to MySql having Databases full of Tables which contain Fields
// Documentation: https://influxdb.com/docs/v0.8/api/query_language.html
//
// Selection Examples
// Select ALL measurements FROM series Downtown
SELECT * FROM Downtown

//Select temperature measurements FROM series Downtown
SELECT temperature FROM Downtown

//Count how many temperature measurements are in series Downtown
SELECT count(temperature) FROM Downtown

//The GROUP BY clause is used with aggregate functions; https://influxdb.com/docs/v0.8/api/aggregate_functions.html
//Select the average temperature of every hour
SELECT MEAN(temperature) FROM Downtown GROUP BY time(1h)

//Select how many temperature measurements are taken each day
SELECT count(temperature) FROM Downtown GROUP BY time(24h)

//Select the highest temperature of each day
SELECT MAX(temperature) FROM Downtown GROUP BY time(24h)

//Select temperatures from only 2015-07-20 (July 20th, 2015)
SELECT temperature FROM Downtown WHERE '2015-07-20' < time and time < '2015-07-21'

//Select temperatures from only 2015-07-20; adjusted for Eastern Daylight Time (+4 hours)
SELECT temperature FROM Downtown WHERE '2015-07-20' + 4h < time and time < '2015-07-21' + 4h
