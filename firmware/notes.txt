=========================
I have been fumbling around with trying to update my SFP module from "00170901" (AT-thinker Firmware) as given by "AT+GMR".

I tried to update using "AT+CIUPDATE" but got an Error after the fourth step instead of OK, so I tried to do it manually using flash_download_tool_v1.2_150512, but I fear I really botched things up since now I get a "MEM CHECK FAIL" from the module, and pressing enter after a command using Putty just puts the cursor back at the beginning of the line instead of executing the command (such as AT+GMR).

I have attempted to flash the firmware using the most recent SDK (esp_iot_sdk_v1.2.0_15_07_03) as per [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkZrrydLw-8) video, but I afterwards began to receive the memcheck error. I also attempted to flash the module as per the directions in the SDK readme but still same issue. I fear I probably overwrote some critical sections of flash and before botching things up further, I wanted to make sure I have an up to date resource.

So, does anyone know what files go to what locations from the most recent SDK so I can get my SFP-01 back up and running? Assume that I overwrote the entire flash with 0's, so I am starting from scratch. I wasn't sure if I should have posted this here or on the official [here](http://bbs.espressif.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=680).

### How to manually flash new SDK
esp_iot_sdk_v1.2.0\bin\at\eagle.flash.bin         0x00000
esp_iot_sdk_v1.2.0\bin\at\eagle.irom0text.bin     0x40000
esp_iot_sdk_v1.2.0\bin\blank.bin                  0x3e000
esp_iot_sdk_v1.2.0\bin\blank.bin                  0x7e000
esp_iot_sdk_v1.2.0\bin\esp_init_data_default.bin  0xFC000
26 Mhz crystal
40 MHZ SPI speed, Quad I/O, 4 megabit (SpiAutoSet probably does this automatically, need to check)
Now running at 115200 default, need to reset to lower speed because softserial sucks butt and can't keep up that fast. Reset to 9600 baud via AT+UART_DEF=9600,8,1,0,0

Also, putty does not offer to do a proper carriage return, so press enter and then ctrl-j after every command if you need to use putty. Suprisingly enough, the Arduino serial monitor has an option for newline and carriage return which works correctly.

### Output of GMR now.
AT+GMR

AT version:0.30.0.0(Jul  3 2015 19:35:49)
SDK version:1.2.0
compile time:Jul  3 2015 20:52:41



Pinout of wifi module:
TX -> RX
RX -> TX
CH_PD -> 3v3
VCC -> 3v3
GND -> GND
RST -> OPEN

pull RST down only for a second and let go, it will restart the module
